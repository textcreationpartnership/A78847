            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruſty and Wellbeloved, We greet you well. We received lately a Petition from the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Common-Councell of Our Citty of <hi>London,</hi> by the hands of Perſons entruſted by them for the delivery, who found ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from Vs, as well manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Our regard to that body which ſent them; Though We well knew by whom that Petition was framed, and where peruſed and examined, before it was approved by thoſe from whom it ſeemed to be ſent, yet We were ſo willing to enter into a correſpondence with that Our Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to receive any addreſſe and application from them, according to that Invitation We had given by Our late Proclamation; And were ſo glad to find that there
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155671:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 75 -->was yet ſome hopes they would look to the Peace and happineſſe of that Citty, and at laſt ſever themſelves from any Faction or dependence, which might inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve them in thoſe Calamities they did not Foreſee, that We returned ſuch a gratious Anſwer thereunto, ſo full of Candor and Affection, that the meaneſt Inhabitant of that Our Citty, if he carefully conſider the ſame, will find himſelfe concerned in it, and that We have had an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall care of his particular. With this Anſwer of Ours We ſent a ſervant of Our own, in the company of thoſe who had been ſo well uſed here, to require and ſee that it might be communicated to the whole body of that Our Citty; not doubting but that both it &amp; the Bringei ſhould receive ſuch Entertainment there, as might maniteſt their due regard of Vs, &amp; of Our Affection to them: But to Our great wonder, We finde that after ten daies Attendance, and ſuffering ridiculous Pamphlets to be publiſhed in Our name, as if We retracted Our former Reſolutions, (which Pamphlet We have cauſed to be burned by the hand of the Hangman, as We alſo require you to ſee don) inſtead of that admiſſion We expected to Our Meſſenger and Meſſage, guards of Armed Men have been brought to keep Our good Subjects, to whom that Our Anſwer was directed, from being preſent at the reading thereof; and Speeches have been made by Strangers (who have been admitted to the Citty Councells, contrary to the Freedome and Cuſtome of thoſe meetings,) to Blaſt Our ſaid Anſwer, and to Diſhonour and Slander Vs, which if Our good Subjects there ſhall ſuffer, We ſhall be much diſcouraged in Our deſired correſpondence with that Our Citty, and ſo by the cunning and power of thoſe Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries mentioned in Our Anſwer (Alderman <hi>Pennington</hi> (who to ſhow his great Loyalty to Vs, and his fitneſſe to

And whereas We are informed that one <hi>Browne</hi> a Wood-monger, <hi>Titch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi> a Linnen-Draper, and one <hi>Harvy</hi> a Silke-man, have exerciſed great Inſolencies and outrages in that Our Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and when many of Our good Subjects there, have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together in a peaceable and modeſt manner, to conſult about the Peace and welfare of that Citty, the ſaid mutinous and ſeditious Perſons have preſumed to lead Multitudes of armed Men againſt them, and by ſuch force have beaten, wounded, and killed Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; Our Will and Pleaſure is, that if the ſaid <hi>Browne, Titchborne,</hi> and <hi>Harvy,</hi> or either of them, ſhall ſo farre neglect Our gratious offer of Pardon, as ſtill to engage themſelves in thoſe unwarrantable and ſeditious courſed, That you Our Sheriffes of <hi>London,</hi> raiſe power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſaid force, and that you and all Our Miniſters of Iuſtice, uſe your utmoſt meanes to apprehend the ſaid Perſons, and to bring them to condigne puniſhment.

               <!-- PDF PAGE 78 -->Perſons, if they ſhall hereafter, in ſuch a Warlike manner, endeavour to moleſt them as they would doe Rebells &amp; Traitours: And We hope that all Our good Subjects of that Our much injured Citty of <hi>London,</hi> doe take notice of Our Grace and Favour towards them in Our ſo freely paſſing by and pardoning the Offences there committed againſt Us, as We have offered by Our Proclamation and Our late Anſwer; and of Our very earneſt deſire to be with them, and to reſide amongſt them for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Support, and Protection, if they ſhall, by firſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for their owne ſecurity (in ſuch manner as We have directed them in Our late Anſwer) give Vs an inſtance that We may be ſafe there too; And that they doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obſerve, that being by ſuch violence kept from them, We have done Our utmoſt endeavour to continue and advance the decayed trading of that Our Citty, by permitting and encouraging all reſort and traffique thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore if by the ſtopping of Carriages, and ſeizing Commodities by other men, the commerce and correſpondence be broken betweene that place and Our good Subjects of other Counties, they will impute that miſchiefe to the true Authors of it, and looke upon Us only as not able to helpe them. Doe but your Duties, and this Cloud, which threatens a preſent confuſion, will quickly vaniſh away, and you will enjoy all the Bleſſings of a happy Nation, to the which no endeavour of Ours ſhall be wanting.</p>
